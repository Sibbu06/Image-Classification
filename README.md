Overview
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 3 categories. It uses TensorFlow/Keras to implement the model and leverages TensorBoard's HParams plugin for hyperparameter tuning and visualization.

Project Components
1. Data Preparation
The code loads training, validation, and test datasets from .npz files. It preprocesses the image data by scaling the pixel values between 0 and 1 to ensure optimal model convergence.

2. Hyperparameters
The code tunes the following hyperparameters:

filter_size (3, 5, 7): The size of the convolutional filters.
filter_num (64, 96, 128): The number of filters (channels) in the convolutional layers.
These hyperparameters impact the CNN's ability to extract meaningful features from images.

3. CNN Architecture
The model uses a sequential CNN structure:

Conv2D Layers: Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
MaxPooling: Reduces spatial dimensions to avoid overfitting.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense Layer: Outputs logits for 3 categories.
The model is compiled with:

Adam Optimizer: Ensures efficient gradient updates.
SparseCategoricalCrossentropy: Suitable for multi-class classification.
Accuracy: Monitored as the evaluation metric.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
The project:

Iterates through all combinations of filter_size and filter_num.
Trains the CNN for 15 epochs with a batch size of 64.
Implements EarlyStopping to stop training when validation loss plateaus.
Each trial logs:

Hyperparameters used.
Accuracy achieved.

5. TensorBoard Integration
HParams Plugin: Logs and visualizes hyperparameter tuning trials.
TensorBoard Dashboard: Displays training/validation accuracy, loss curves, and hyperparameter performance metrics.
The logs are saved in:

logs/Model 1/hparam_tuning/: Hyperparameter tuning logs.
logs/Model 1/fit/: Training metrics for each session.
